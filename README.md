NOW DEPRECATED, USE THE DEV BRANCH THAT IS ACTUALLY COMPATIBLE WITH THE NEW LINUX LINDBERGH LOADER VERSION

![install-script](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7caefee-ddce-491e-8ee5-ed18f2fb8d5c)


These scripts are for a fresh ubuntu-22.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso based os installation

DON'T USE ON ANY OTHER VERSION THEN THE UBUNTU 22.04.5 !!!

mark the scripts as executable:

chmod +x filename.sh

Then you can execute it like this:

./filename.sh


lloader-v6.sh will install all the lindbergh loader requirements and autocompile the loader for you

lindbergh-plymouth.sh will install a simple lindbergh loader plymouth boot theme

Feel free to report me bugs!

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
