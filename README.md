# Lindbergh Loader v7 Development Script

This repository contains the **lloader-v7dev.sh** script, a comprehensive automation tool for setting up and building the Lindbergh Loader and its required dependencies on a Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux system.

## What Does This Script Do?

The script is designed to automate the following tasks:

1. **System Preparation**
    - Adds the current user to the `dialout` and `input` groups (needed for hardware and device access).
    - Enables support for 32-bit (`i386`) architecture, required for certain dependencies.
    - Updates and upgrades the system package lists.

2. **Dependency Installation**
    - Checks for Git and installs it if missing.
    - Installs a broad set of build tools and libraries, including 32-bit and multilib packages required for Lindbergh Loader and related components.
    - Installs audio, graphics, and other essential libraries for both development and runtime.

3. **Build Dependencies from Source**
    - Clones and builds the latest SDL3, SDL3_ttf, SDL3_image, and FAudio from their respective upstream repositories, targeting 32-bit builds for compatibility.
    - Installs these freshly built libraries system-wide.

4. **Lindbergh Loader Build**
    - Clones the [lindbergh-loader](https://github.com/lindbergh-loader/lindbergh-loader) repository.
    - Builds Lindbergh Loader using `make`.
    - Generates default configuration and control files using the built executable.

5. **Theme Installation**
    - Clones the [lindbergh-plymouth](https://github.com/Francesco-75/lindbergh-plymouth) theme repository.
    - Copies the theme background image to your Pictures directory.
    - Sets the GNOME desktop background to the new image.

6. **System Setup**
    - Installs `gnome-control-center` if not already present (for desktop settings).
    - Disables `brltty` services (Braille display support) to prevent conflicts with some input devices.


## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Francesco-75/lindbergh-loader-scripts.git
   cd lindbergh-loader-scripts
   ```

2. **Run the Script**

   > **Warning:** This script requires `sudo` privileges and will reboot your system at the end.  
   > Make sure you have saved your work before proceeding.

   ```bash
   chmod +x lloader-v7dev.sh
   ./lloader-v7dev.sh
   ```

3. **Follow On-Screen Prompts**
    - The script will prompt before rebooting. Press Enter to continue or Ctrl+C to cancel the reboot.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04.5 Linux distribution
- Internet connection (for cloning repositories and downloading packages)
- Sudo privileges

## Notes

- This script modifies system libraries and user groups, and installs/removes packages. Use with caution, ideally on a fresh or dedicated system. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
- The script is intended for development and testing purposes and may install a large number of dependencies.
